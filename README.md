==========================

A chart describing the problem domain of my submission to the basic card game assignment for F1 Code Fellows class.

This chart describes how two players draw random cards from a deck, compare those cards, and win or lose the round
based on whose card has the highest rank value. Cards are drawn one at a time, and the rank of the cards increase from
1 to 10, and Jack to Ace. This simple game is centered around the PlayGame constructor function and consists of 10
rounds.
